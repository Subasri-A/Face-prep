    <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms belonging to the biological kingdom Animalia. They are characterized by their ability to move, consume organic material, breathe oxygen, and reproduce sexually. Most animals are motile, meaning they can move independently and spontaneously at some point in their life cycle.</p>
